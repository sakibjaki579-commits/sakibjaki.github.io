### Problem statement
The problem is about medicine shortage and variations in availability along with different prices across Health Establishments. Patients are finding it difficult to find spesific medicines that are in stock or is too expensive. This leads to delays in treatments and pressure on healthcare services. There is currently no type of app/tool that lets people check certian medical services or what medicine are provided by health services.

2. Pressure will be reduced on Healthcare Services

When people know which Health Services they need to go to or what medicine they need, this will reduce long queues and phone queries etc.

3. Better planning for resources

This is a benifit becasue Health Services can use data to understand which areas have high demand, which facilities have medicine shortages and support etc.

4. It will increase trustworthiness

This means that based on the accurate data users will be comfortable with going to certain Health Serivces. 

5. Cost savings

This is a benifit because based on the data Health Services will know what medicine is in stock and what problems are being faced with some clinics or pharmacies.
