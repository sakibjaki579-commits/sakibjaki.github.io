# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
The problem is about medicine shortage and variations in availability along with different prices across Health Establishments. Patients are finding it difficult to find specific medicines that are in stock or is too expensive. This leads to delays in treatments and pressure on healthcare services. There is currently no type of app/tool that lets people check certian medical services or what medicine are provided by health services. 

### Business benefits
1. It will improve access to halthcare information

This means that it will show the user where each Health Establishments are located and the services that they provide are. Which will help people to go to the right places.

2. Pressure will be reduced on Healthcare Services

When people know which Health Services they need to go to or what medicine they need, this will reduce long queues and phone queries etc.

3. Better planning for resources

This is a benifit becasue Health Services can use data to understand which areas have high demand, which facilities have medicine shortages and support etc.

4. It will increase trustworthiness

This means that based on the accurate data users will be comfortable with going to certain Health Serivces. 

5. Cost savings

This is a benifit because based on the data Health Services will know what medicine is in stock and what problems are being faced with some clinics or pharmacies. 

### Options Considered
There are a couple of options such as NHS app/website, individual pharmacy websites, Google maps and Third party Pharmacy Apps.

NHS app/website - This provides general information about health services, opening hours and service categories. They don't however give any details about location shortages of medicine. This means that patients still need to visit or phone multiple places to check if they have the medicine needed.

Individual Pharmacy Websites - Pharmacies sometimes list their opening times and service information online, but they don't provide all of the locations in that city at once which means that users have to visit each website individualy which causes a time constraint. 

Google Maps - Google Maps shows accurate Pharmacy locations and user reviews. It doesn't however show any information about medicine shortages, prices of products and stock levels.

Third party Pharmacy apps - Some of these third party apps do compare the prices. However they may be outdated or incomplete, they may not include health centres and clinics and they may not cover local NHS services.  

### Expected Risks
1. Inaccurate or outdated data - Medicine stock or prices may not always be up to date.

2. Data integration issues - Different pharmacies and clinics may use different systems.

3. Security and privacy concerns - User data must be protected.

4. Dependence on external partners - The system relies on pharmacies/health services to provide data.

5. Low user adoption - People may prefer existing tools like Google Maps or the NHS app.

6. Technical failures - App slow performance can affect usability.

## Project Scope
1. Using data from Bristol City Council about medical supplies.

2. Getting information from NHS/local health organisations.

3. Showing pharmacy locations to the user.

4. Creating a basic mobile app to display the information.

5. Allowing public users to search for medicine and services.

6. Collecting user feedback to help improve the system.

7. Bringing all this information together inside the Health Establishment system.
