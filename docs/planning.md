# Project Proposal

## Business Case
This project will propse the development of a web based application that will use Open Data API to help users locate nearby pharmacies. The application will provide a simple user interface that will display pharmacy details like names and the type of services etc. Our goal is to make a system that will save users time and improve access to healthcare services. 

### Problem statement
The problem is having access to pharmacy services in Bristol as it is challenging for patients and even residents who need to quickly locate nearby pharmacies. The existing tools like Google maps and the NHS website do not provide simple filtering options using open data. This makes users needing to check multiple sources to find accurate information. At the current moment there isn't an easy to use platform thta displays pharmacy locations from the Bristol Open Data portal.

### Business benefits
1. improved access to services - Users can quickly locate nearby pharmacies without searching multiple websites.
2. Better decision making - People can compare locations and are able to choose the nearest pharmacy.
3. Reducing time and confusion - Being able to find the local pharmacy will reduce queues amd phone queries that aren't needed.
4. Supports public health faster - In an emergancy there is faster access to pharmacy services.
5. Efficient use of open data - Utilises Bristol Open Data portal effectively. 

### Options Considered
1. NHS website - This provides general healthcare information but does not offer detailed city specific filtering for pharmacies using open data.
2. Google Maps - This shows pharmacy locations but it lacks structured open data integregation and doesn't guarentee accuraccy and consistency across all services.
3. Individual Pharmacy websites - These don't allow users to compare multiple pharmacies at once.
4. Third party apps - Third party apps can list pharmaies but are often outdated.



### Expected Risks
1. Inaccurate or outdated data - Medicine stock or prices may not always be up to date.

2. Data integration issues - Different pharmacies and clinics may use different systems.

3. Security and privacy concerns - User data must be protected.

4. Dependence on external partners - The system relies on pharmacies/health services to provide data.

5. Low user adoption - People may prefer existing tools like Google Maps or the NHS app.

6. Technical failures - App slow performance can affect usability.

## Project Scope
1. Using data from Bristol City Council about medical supplies.

2. Getting information from NHS/local health organisations.

3. Showing pharmacy locations to the user.

4. Creating a basic mobile app to display the information.

5. Allowing public users to search for medicine and services.

6. Collecting user feedback to help improve the system.

7. Bringing all this information together inside the Health Establishment system.
