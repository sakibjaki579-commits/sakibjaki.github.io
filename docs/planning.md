# Project Proposal

## Business Case
This project will propse the development of a web based application that will use Open Data API to help users locate nearby pharmacies. The application will provide a simple user interface that will display pharmacy details like names and the type of services etc. Our goal is to make a system that will save users time and improve access to healthcare services. 

### Problem statement
The problem is having access to pharmacy services in Bristol as it is challenging for patients and even residents who need to quickly locate nearby pharmacies. The existing tools like Google maps and the NHS website do not provide simple filtering options using open data. This makes users needing to check multiple sources to find accurate information. At the current moment there isn't an easy to use platform thta displays pharmacy locations from the Bristol Open Data portal.

### Business benefits


### Options Considered
There are a couple of options such as NHS app/website, individual pharmacy websites, Google maps and Third party Pharmacy Apps.

NHS app/website - This provides general information about health services, opening hours and service categories. They don't however give any details about location shortages of medicine. This means that patients still need to visit or phone multiple places to check if they have the medicine needed.

Individual Pharmacy Websites - Pharmacies sometimes list their opening times and service information online, but they don't provide all of the locations in that city at once which means that users have to visit each website individualy which causes a time constraint. 

Google Maps - Google Maps shows accurate Pharmacy locations and user reviews. It doesn't however show any information about medicine shortages, prices of products and stock levels.

Third party Pharmacy apps - Some of these third party apps do compare the prices. However they may be outdated or incomplete, they may not include health centres and clinics and they may not cover local NHS services.  

### Expected Risks
1. Inaccurate or outdated data - Medicine stock or prices may not always be up to date.

2. Data integration issues - Different pharmacies and clinics may use different systems.

3. Security and privacy concerns - User data must be protected.

4. Dependence on external partners - The system relies on pharmacies/health services to provide data.

5. Low user adoption - People may prefer existing tools like Google Maps or the NHS app.

6. Technical failures - App slow performance can affect usability.

## Project Scope
1. Using data from Bristol City Council about medical supplies.

2. Getting information from NHS/local health organisations.

3. Showing pharmacy locations to the user.

4. Creating a basic mobile app to display the information.

5. Allowing public users to search for medicine and services.

6. Collecting user feedback to help improve the system.

7. Bringing all this information together inside the Health Establishment system.
